# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The BondMCP platform uses a sophisticated Model Context Protocol (MCP) to ensure the accuracy and safety of our AI-generated medical advice. The MCP is a set of rules and procedures that govern how our AI models interact with each other and with external data sources.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Model Consensus:** The MCP uses a multi-model consensus system to generate medical advice. This means that we use multiple AI models to generate advice, and then we use a consensus algorithm to determine the best advice.
- **Hallucination Detection:** The MCP includes a hallucination detection system that is designed to detect and prevent our AI models from generating false or misleading information.
- **Trust Certificate Verification:** The MCP uses a trust certificate verification system to ensure that our AI models are using reliable and trustworthy data sources.
- **Medical Safety Scoring:** The MCP includes a medical safety scoring system that is designed to assess the safety of our AI-generated medical advice.

## How it Works

The MCP works by creating a secure and isolated environment for our AI models to operate in. This environment is designed to protect our models from external threats and to ensure that they are using reliable and trustworthy data sources. The MCP also includes a set of rules and procedures that govern how our AI models interact with each other and with external data sources. These rules and procedures are designed to ensure that our AI models are generating accurate and safe medical advice.

## Benefits

The MCP provides a number of benefits, including:

- **Improved Accuracy:** The MCP helps to improve the accuracy of our AI-generated medical advice by using a multi-model consensus system and by ensuring that our AI models are using reliable and trustworthy data sources.
- **Enhanced Safety:** The MCP helps to enhance the safety of our AI-generated medical advice by including a hallucination detection system and a medical safety scoring system.
- **Increased Trust:** The MCP helps to increase trust in our AI-generated medical advice by using a trust certificate verification system.
