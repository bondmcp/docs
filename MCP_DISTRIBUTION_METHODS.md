# MCP Distribution Methods for Healthcare

## Technical Distribution Components

### 1. Open-Source Protocol Specification and SDKs

- MCP is released as an open-source standard by Anthropic
- Developers can access the protocol specification and SDKs through Anthropic's repositories
- The open-source nature enables widespread adoption and community contributions
- Language-specific SDKs facilitate implementation across different technology stacks

### 2. MCP Client-Server Architecture

- **MCP Clients**: Components that connect directly to AI models
  - Examples: Claude, Tempo, Windsurf, Cursor
  - In healthcare: Provider-facing interfaces for clinicians or patient-facing applications
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that expose specific capabilities
  - Translate between MCP protocol and actual services/tools
  - Healthcare companies develop MCP servers that expose FHIR APIs, clinical tools, and medical databases
- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or other AI tools that need external data

### 3. Local MCP Server Support

- Claude Desktop apps provide local MCP server support
- Enables testing and development without cloud deployment
- Particularly important for healthcare applications with sensitive data
- Allows developers to test integrations locally before deploying to production

### 4. Pre-Built MCP Servers

- Open-source repositories of MCP servers for popular enterprise systems
- Examples include connectors for Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer
- Healthcare-specific connectors for EHR systems, FHIR databases, and clinical tools
- Reduces development time by providing ready-to-use components

### 5. Healthcare-Specific Protocol Extensions (HMCP)

- Healthcare Model Context Protocol (HMCP) is an industry-specific profile of MCP
- Provides alignment with national standards like FHIR U.S. Core
- Includes terminology normalization across SNOMED, LOINC, and RxNorm
- Offers risk scoring to block unsafe or out-of-scope requests in real time
- Includes specialty plug-ins (e.g., DICOM for radiology, VCF parsing for genomics)

## Distribution Channels and Ecosystem

### 1. Claude for Work Integration

- Enterprise customers can access MCP through Claude for Work
- Testing MCP servers locally for internal systems and datasets
- Developer toolkits for deploying remote production MCP servers
- Organization-wide deployment capabilities

### 2. Desktop Application Distribution

- Claude Desktop app as an entry point for MCP adoption
- Pre-built MCP servers available through desktop application
- Local testing and development environment
- Particularly useful for healthcare developers working with sensitive data

### 3. Development Platform Integrations

- Integration with popular development platforms:
  - Zed: Fast, collaborative code editor
  - Replit: Online platform for writing and running code
  - Codeium: AI coding assistant
  - Sourcegraph: Code search and intelligence platform
- Enables AI agents to better understand context around coding tasks
- Facilitates development of healthcare-specific applications

### 4. Enterprise Software Partnerships

- Microsoft has embraced MCP in Copilot Studio
- Allows enterprise users to add AI apps and agents via MCP with minimal configuration
- Integration with Visual Studio Code for development workflows
- Enterprise software vendors creating MCP-compatible connectors

### 5. Healthcare Platform Integrations

- EHR vendors developing MCP connectors for their systems
- FHIR API providers offering MCP-compatible interfaces
- Clinical decision support systems integrating with MCP
- Healthcare data exchange networks supporting MCP for interoperability

## Implementation and Adoption Approach

### 1. Phased Implementation Strategy

- Start with low-risk use cases (note generation, lab summarization)
- Apply "least privilege" access principles
- Introduce audit transparency
- Measure impact on documentation time, alert quality, length of stay, safety metrics
- Expand to additional use cases

### 2. Developer Resources and Documentation

- Quickstart guides for building first MCP server
- Comprehensive documentation for healthcare-specific implementations
- Code examples and reference implementations
- Community forums and support channels

### 3. Open Community Collaboration

- Collaborative, open-source project and ecosystem
- Contributions from developers across the healthcare industry
- Shared best practices and implementation patterns
- Continuous improvement through community feedback

## Healthcare-Specific Distribution Considerations

### 1. FHIR Integration

- MCP servers exposing FHIR APIs in a standardized way
- Alignment with FHIR resources (Patient, Medication, Condition, etc.)
- Support for FHIR-based prior authorization packets
- Integration with FHIR-compliant patient portals

### 2. Security and Compliance

- End-to-end encryption using TLS 1.3
- OAuth 2.0 scopes mapped to specific clinical roles
- Break-glass overrides with automated tagging
- Immutable logs of all data requests and responses
- Data minimization principles
- Consent filtering following state and federal laws

### 3. Clinical Workflow Integration

- Integration with documentation workflows
- Support for triage and clinical decision support
- Prior authorization streamlining
- Clinical alerts and early warning systems
- Hospital operations optimization

### 4. Implementation Timeline

- Integration cycles measured in days, not months
- Rapid deployment compared to traditional healthcare integrations
- Incremental adoption approach
- Continuous improvement based on clinical feedback

## Distribution Success Metrics

### 1. Technical Metrics
