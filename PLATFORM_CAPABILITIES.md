## Relationship to AuroraCapital BondMCP Platform

**Status**: Unknown relationship to auroracapital/bondmcp-platform repository.
**Recommendation**: Verify alignment with AuroraCapital platform when accessible.

## Migration Path

When the API infrastructure is deployed:

1. **Immediate**: Test all endpoints against live API
2. **Update documentation**: Replace planned status with actual status
3. **SDK updates**: Enable SDK methods for working endpoints
4. **Example updates**: Replace mock examples with real API calls
5. **Testing**: Implement integration tests against live API
