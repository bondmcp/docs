## API Integration Guide

### Basic API Usage

The BondMCP API follows RESTful principles and uses JSON for request and response bodies. Here's how to make your first API call:

1. **Authentication**
   - Include your API key in the `X-API-Key` header with every request
   - Example:
     ```
     X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY
     ```

2. **Making Your First API Call**
   - Start with a simple health check to verify your setup:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET "https://api.bondmcp.com/health" \
       -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
     ```
   - Expected response:
     ```json
     {
       "status": "healthy",
       "version": "0.1.0",
       "timestamp": "2024-05-17T09:48:00.123Z",
       "environment": "production",
       "services": {
         "llm": "healthy",
         "redis": "healthy",
         "database": "healthy"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling for all API calls
   - Check HTTP status codes (200 for success, 4xx for client errors, 5xx for server errors)
   - Parse error messages from the response body for troubleshooting
   - Implement appropriate retry logic for transient errors

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Be aware of the rate limits for your subscription tier
   - Implement backoff strategies for rate limit errors (HTTP 429)
   - Monitor your usage through the developer dashboard

### Working with the Trust Layer

BondMCP's Trust Layer is a core component that ensures reliable, validated health insights. Here's how to leverage it effectively:

1. **Understanding Trust Layer Processing**
   - The Trust Layer employs multiple LLMs in ensemble to cross-validate results
   - Each request is processed by at least three models (Claude 3, GPT-4o, MedLM)
   - Results are compared and validated against medical knowledge sources
   - A confidence score is assigned based on model consensus and evidence strength

2. **Requesting Trust Layer Processing**
   - Use the `/llm/ask` endpoint for direct LLM queries:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST "https://api.bondmcp.com/llm/ask" \
       -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "prompt": "Explain the relationship between vitamin D levels and immune function",
         "model_names": ["claude-3-sonnet", "gpt-4o"],
         "temperature": 0.5,
         "use_cache": true
       }'
     ```

3. **Interpreting Trust Layer Responses**
   - Examine the `metadata` field for information about model consensus
   - Check the `score` value to assess confidence in the response
   - Review which models contributed to the final response
   - Consider implementing confidence thresholds for your application

4. **Optimizing Trust Layer Requests**
   - Provide clear, specific prompts for best results
   - Include relevant context in your requests
   - Use the `use_cache` parameter to improve response times for repeated queries
   - Consider model-specific parameters when needed

### Implementing Tool Calls

The `/tools/call` endpoint provides access to specialized processing tools within BondMCP:

1. **Understanding Available Tools**
   - Review the complete list of available tools in the API Reference
   - Each tool has specific input requirements and output formats
   - Tools are categorized by domain (lab analysis, supplement recommendations, etc.)

2. **Making Tool Calls**
   - Use the `/tools/call` endpoint with the appropriate tool name:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST "https://api.bondmcp.com/tools/call" \
       -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "tool_name": "lab_result_analyzer",
         "arguments": {
           "lab_data": {
             "test_name": "Vitamin D, 25-Hydroxy",
             "value": 28,
             "unit": "ng/mL",
             "reference_range": "30-100"
           }
         },
         "context": {
           "user_id": "user_123"
         }
       }'
     ```

3. **Processing Tool Responses**
   - Check the `request_id` for tracking and debugging
   - Extract the `result` field for the tool's output
   - Handle any `error` information appropriately
   - Implement proper error recovery for failed tool calls

4. **Chaining Tool Calls**
   - Some complex workflows require sequential tool calls
   - Use the output from one tool call as input to another
   - Maintain context across calls using the `context` field
   - Consider implementing workflow orchestration for complex sequences

## Data Integration Workflows

### Laboratory Data Processing

BondMCP can analyze and interpret laboratory test results. Here's how to implement this workflow:

1. **Preparing Lab Data**

   - Group related tests appropriately (e.g., lipid panel, CBC)
   - Add relevant context such as testing date and patient demographics

2. **Submitting Lab Data for Analysis**
   - Use the appropriate tool call for lab analysis:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST "https://api.bondmcp.com/tools/call" \
       -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{
         "tool_name": "lab_result_analyzer",
