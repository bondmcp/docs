# Why BondMCP

## The Healthcare AI Infrastructure Challenge

Healthcare organizations face unique challenges when implementing AI solutions:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: HIPAA, GDPR, and other healthcare-specific regulations create complex requirements for AI systems
- **Data Security**: Patient data requires the highest level of protection and specialized handling
- **Integration Complexity**: Healthcare systems use specialized data formats and protocols (HL7, FHIR, DICOM)
- **Clinical Accuracy**: AI responses must meet higher standards when health decisions are involved
- **Technical Debt**: Legacy healthcare IT systems create integration challenges
- **Resource Constraints**: Healthcare IT teams are often understaffed and overworked

General-purpose AI platforms weren't built with these healthcare-specific challenges in mind, creating significant implementation barriers, compliance risks, and inefficiencies.
