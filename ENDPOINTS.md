## Known Issues

1. **Method Errors (405)**: 12 endpoints return "Method Not Allowed"
   - Likely due to incorrect HTTP method configuration
   - Affects authentication and API key management

2. **Missing Endpoints (404)**: 24 endpoints not deployed
   - Core health AI functionality missing
   - Research and healthcare services unavailable

3. **Resource Constraints**: Deployment failures due to container termination
   - Upgraded to dedicated instances with autoscaling
   - Still experiencing deployment issues

---

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Method Errors**: Resolve 405 errors for authentication endpoints
2. **Deploy Health AI**: Core product functionality
3. **Complete Authentication**: Enable user registration and login
4. **API Key Management**: Self-service API key generation
