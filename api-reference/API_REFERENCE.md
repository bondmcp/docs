### Python Example (Limited Functionality)

```python
import requests

class BondMCPClient:
    def __init__(self, api_key=None):
        self.base_url = "https://api.bondmcp.com"
        self.api_key = api_key
        
    def get_health(self):
        """Check API health status"""
        response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/health")
