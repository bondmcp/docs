## 🔍 **MCP Integration: Discovery & Capability Management**

BondMCP now supports **Model Control Protocol (MCP)** for dynamic capability discovery and enhanced integration patterns. MCP allows your applications to dynamically discover available endpoints, understand their capabilities, and verify system integrity.

### 🌟 **Key MCP Features**

* **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatically discover available API endpoints and their capabilities
* **Capability Metadata**: Rich information about authentication requirements, rate limits, and usage examples
* **Cryptographic Verification**: SHA256 hashes ensure capability data integrity
* **Version Management**: Standardized capability versioning with deprecation tracking
* **Rate Limit Awareness**: Understand rate limiting tiers before making requests

### 🚀 **Quick MCP Discovery**

```bash
# Get complete MCP configuration
curl https://api.bondmcp.com/.well-known/mcp-configuration

# Get lightweight manifest for verification
curl https://api.bondmcp.com/.well-known/mcp-manifest.json
```

### 📚 **MCP Documentation**

* **[MCP Overview →](docs/mcp/overview.md)** - Learn about MCP configuration, capabilities, and discovery patterns
* **[Consuming Capabilities →](docs/mcp/consuming-capabilities.md)** - Language-specific examples for Python and TypeScript
* **[API Reference →](docs/api-reference/)** - Complete endpoint documentation

### 💡 **Migration Benefits**

* **Future-proof**: Automatically discover new endpoints as they're released
* **Resilient**: Handle deprecated endpoints gracefully with built-in deprecation flags
* **Efficient**: Understand rate limits and auth requirements before making requests
* **Secure**: Verify system integrity with cryptographic capability hashes
