## 🔄 **Contract Ingest Pipeline**

BondMCP uses an automated contract ingest pipeline to ensure safe, deterministic API publishing:

### ✅ **Key Features**
- **Spec Normalization**: Consistent OpenAPI formatting before diff generation
- **Idempotent Publishing**: Automatic version checks prevent duplicate publications  
- **Label Automation**: PRs automatically receive `contract` labels for filtering
- **Migration Safeguards**: Ensures documentation exists for breaking changes
- **Auto-Ready Workflows**: Draft PRs promoted automatically when checks pass

### 🛠️ **Contract Scripts**
```bash
# Normalize OpenAPI specification
npm run contract:normalize -- --in spec/openapi.json --out openapi/latest.normalized.json

# Check if version exists on npm/PyPI
npm run contract:preflight npm 1.0.0
npm run contract:preflight pypi 1.0.0

# Apply contract label to PR
npm run contract:label contract

# Assert migration documentation
npm run contract:migrate
```

### 🔐 **Publishing Safeguards**
- **Exit Code 0**: Safe to publish (version doesn't exist)
- **Exit Code 20**: Skip npm publish (version exists)  
- **Exit Code 21**: Skip PyPI publish (version exists)
- **Migration Assertion**: Major/minor changes require MIGRATIONS documentation

*See [ADR-002](docs/adr/ADR-002-contract-ingest-pipeline.md) for complete implementation details.*
