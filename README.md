## 1. Project Overview

### Mission and Vision
BondMCP is a comprehensive platform designed to transform complex and often unstructured health data into validated, actionable decisions. The core mission of BondMCP is to provide a unified "language" that can be understood and trusted by diverse systems, including wearables, hospital EMRs, consumer health applications, and laboratory information systems. By enforcing rigorous cross-model validation (utilizing a minimum of three Large Language Models), semantic grounding through verifiable sources, and offering public APIs, BondMCP aims to become the internet's trust layer for health. This ensures that insights and recommendations derived from health data are not only intelligent but also reliable and precise, fostering greater confidence in AI-driven healthcare solutions.

### Key Domains
**Unified Developer Portal: `api.bondmcp.com`**
Moving forward, `api.bondmcp.com` will serve as the single, unified developer command center. It will consolidate all developer-facing functionalities, including:
*   Comprehensive API documentation and an interactive API explorer (Swagger UI/OpenAPI).
*   Downloadable Software Development Kits (SDKs).
*   Demonstrations of core capabilities, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
*   An interactive API sandbox/playground for live testing of endpoints.
*   Developer account registration and management (integrated with AWS Cognito).
*   API key generation and management.
*   Billing and subscription management.

**Marketing and Information: `bondmcp.com`**
*   This domain will continue to function as the main marketing and informational website, featuring product details, thought leadership content, and general company information.

**Deprecation Notice: `my.bondmcp.com`**
*   The domain `my.bondmcp.com`, which previously hosted the user interface demonstration, AI-powered health chat, API sandbox, billing, and API key generation, is being deprecated. All its functionalities are being merged into the unified `api.bondmcp.com` portal. Users should transition to using `api.bondmcp.com` for all developer-related activities.

## 2. System Architecture

### High-Level Design
The BondMCP system is architected as a robust, cloud-native platform leveraging Amazon Web Services (AWS) for scalability, reliability, and security. The architecture is designed to support a high volume of API requests, complex data processing, and real-time interactions, while ensuring data integrity and compliance with health data standards.

### Backend Services (FastAPI)
The backend of BondMCP is built using FastAPI, a modern, high-performance Python web framework. This choice allows for rapid development, automatic data validation, and interactive API documentation generation (following OpenAPI standards). The backend services are containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate for serverless compute. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) distributes incoming traffic across the ECS tasks.

Key backend responsibilities include API endpoint management, Trust Layer logic implementation, data processing and orchestration (including calls to LLMs via AWS Bedrock), database interaction with Aurora PostgreSQL (using pgvector), and integration with AWS Cognito for authentication.

### Frontend Applications (Next.js)
The primary frontend for all developer interactions, including the developer portal, API playground, account management, and API key generation, is `api.bondmcp.com`. This unified portal is built as a Next.js application. Next.js, a React framework, enables server-side rendering and static site generation. The frontend utilizes TypeScript, MagicUI, 21dev components, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN/UI.

Key frontend aspects include UI components for the developer portal, API interaction, state management, an interactive API playground, user account and billing management interfaces, and rendering of Markdown-based documentation (MDX).

## 4. API Reference

### Accessing the API
The BondMCP API provides programmatic access to its suite of health AI features. The API is designed following RESTful principles and uses JSON for request and response bodies. Comprehensive, interactive API documentation is available via the embedded OpenAPI specification (Swagger UI) on the `api.bondmcp.com` developer portal.

**Important Note on OpenAPI Specification:** The definitive OpenAPI schema for BondMCP is generated dynamically by its FastAPI application. For the most accurate and up-to-date API development and documentation, always refer to the OpenAPI schema exposed by the live `api.bondmcp.com` service (typically accessible at a `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, or `/redoc` path) or the schema generated directly from the BondMCP FastAPI application's source code. This documentation aims to reflect this live schema.

### Authentication (Cognito & API Keys)
Access to the BondMCP API is secured using API keys and OAuth2 through AWS Cognito. All related management tasks, including API key generation and Cognito user account management, are handled within the unified `api.bondmcp.com` developer portal.

*   **API Keys:** For server-to-server communication, include the API key in the `X-API-Key` HTTP header. These keys are generated and managed via your developer account on the `api.bondmcp.com` portal.
*   **OAuth2 (Cognito):** For user-centric flows and access to the developer portal features, BondMCP utilizes AWS Cognito. Authenticated users receive JWTs (ID and Access Tokens) which should be sent as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` HTTP header for relevant API calls. Detailed OAuth2 flow information is available via the Cognito User Pool configuration and the developer portal at `api.bondmcp.com`.

### Key Endpoints Overview
The BondMCP API, as defined in `app/main.py`, currently exposes the following key endpoints:

*   **`GET /health`** (Tag: Health)
    *   Provides a health check of the API and its dependent services.
*   **`POST /tools/call`** (Tag: MCP Tools)
    *   A generic endpoint for dispatching calls to various internal tools and services registered within the BondMCP framework. Requires API key authentication.
*   **`POST /llm/ask`** (Tag: AI Services)
    *   Allows direct querying of the configured LLM ensemble. Returns the best response from multiple models. Requires API key authentication.

Details for these endpoints, including request and response schemas, are provided below and in the OpenAPI specification generated by the application (accessible via `/docs` or `/redoc` on the running service).

*(The illustrative examples for `/v1/labs/analyze` and `/v1/supplements/recommend` previously in this section have been removed as they are not currently defined in `app/main.py`. The documentation should only reflect actual, implemented endpoints. If these features are implemented via the `/tools/call` endpoint, specific tool names and argument structures for them would need to be documented separately, likely under a dedicated "MCP Tools Usage" section or by expanding the `/tools/call` description.)*`

### Rate Limiting
API requests are subject to rate limiting based on subscription tier. Check `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, and `X-RateLimit-Reset` HTTP headers. Exceeding limits results in a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

### Error Handling
The API uses standard HTTP status codes. Error responses typically include a JSON body with `detail`, `error_code`, and optionally `errors` for validation issues (common with FastAPI for `422 Unprocessable Entity` errors). Key error codes include `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, `429 Too Many Requests`, and `5xx Server Errors`.

**Detailed Error Response Examples:**
*   **422 Unprocessable Entity (Schema Validation Error from FastAPI):**
    ```json
    {
      "detail": [
        {
          "loc": ["body", "lab_results", 0, "value"],
          "msg": "value is not a valid float",
          "type": "type_error.float"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
*   **503 Service Unavailable (e.g., Bedrock Model Issue):**
    ```json
    {
      "detail": "The underlying AI model service (Bedrock) is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.",
      "error_code": "BEDROCK_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE"
    }
    ```

## 5. Software Development Kits (SDKs)

To facilitate easier integration with the BondMCP API, official SDKs for popular programming languages are planned. Initially, SDKs for Node.js and Python will be prioritized.
*   **Node.js SDK:** `npm install @bondmcp/sdk` (Planned)
*   **Python SDK:** `pip install bondmcp` (Planned)
These SDKs will provide convenient wrappers around the API endpoints, handle authentication, and simplify request/response processing. Links to the SDK repositories on GitHub and their respective documentation will be provided on `api.bondmcp.com` once available. Downloadable ZIP bundles of example SDK usage will also be provided in the `/downloads` section of the developer portal.

## 6. Developer Guide

### Getting Started with the API
1.  **Register for an Account:** Visit the unified developer portal at `api.bondmcp.com` to create your developer account. This will give you access to the API documentation, interactive playground, API key management, and billing information.
2.  **Obtain API Credentials:** Once registered and logged in, navigate to the API key management section within your `api.bondmcp.com` dashboard to generate your API key.
3.  **Review API Documentation:** Familiarize yourself with the API endpoints, request/response schemas, and authentication methods detailed on `api.bondmcp.com`.
4.  **Utilize SDKs (Recommended):** Check the [SDKs section](#5-software-development-kits-sdks) for available SDKs to simplify your integration.
5.  **Make Your First API Call:** Test your setup by calling a simple endpoint, such as `/health`, or an endpoint relevant to your use case, using your generated API key. Example cURL for a generic endpoint: `curl -H "X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.bondmcp.com/tools/call` (replace with actual tool name and arguments).
6.  **Explore Use Cases & Playground:** Dive into the [Illustrative Use Cases](#illustrative-use-cases) and experiment with the interactive API playground on `api.bondmcp.com` to better understand the API's capabilities.

### Working with the Trust Layer
BondMCP's Trust Layer ensures reliable AI insights through:
*   **Multi-Model Validation:** Outputs are processed by an ensemble of LLMs via AWS Bedrock.
*   **Semantic Grounding & Source Traceability:** API responses may include source references (e.g., PubMed).
*   **Confidence Scores:** Some endpoints may return confidence scores for predictions.

### API Integration Best Practices
*   **Secure Credentials:** Never embed API keys in client-side code. Use environment variables or secure backend storage.
*   **Handle Asynchronous Operations:** Design for long-running API calls using webhooks or polling with backoff.
*   **Ensure Input Data Quality:** Accurate input leads to quality insights.
*   **Implement Robust Error Handling & Retries:** Handle errors gracefully and retry transient issues (429, 503) with exponential backoff.
*   **Client-Side Logging:** Log API requests/responses (excluding sensitive data) for debugging.
*   **Stay Updated:** Check `api.bondmcp.com` and the [Changelog](#9-changelog) for updates.

### Illustrative Use Cases
(Backed by real data, diagrams, and live endpoint references on `api.bondmcp.com`)

*   **Wearable-Powered Health Assistant:** Ingest wearable data, correlate with lab results via `/labs/analyze`, generate verified health plans.
*   **Chatbot with Validated Medical Knowledge:** Use `/rag/query` as a validation fallback for health-related queries in chatbots.
*   **Automated Bloodwork Analysis:** Upload bloodwork to `/labs/analyze` for automated interpretation and RAG-supported insights.
*   **Personalized Supplement Plan Generation:** Use `/supplements/recommend` with user profiles for evidence-backed supplement plans.
*   **Adding Trust to Existing RAG Pipelines:** Use BondMCP (e.g., `/rag/validate-context`) to verify information from other RAG systems.

Each use case on `api.bondmcp.com` will include detailed explanations, request/response examples, live endpoint references, and MagicUI rendering examples.

## 7. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

## 9. Changelog

A detailed changelog will track updates, new features, fixes, and breaking changes. It will be accessible on `api.bondmcp.com` and potentially linked here. The changelog aims to be auto-pulled from GitHub commits (conventional commits format) and grouped by release/version.

**Conceptual Format:**

### Version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)
*   **Added:** New feature A; Endpoint `/new-feature`.
*   **Changed:** Improved performance of Y; Updated schema for `/existing-endpoint`.
*   **Fixed:** Bug in Z component.

*Self-Correction Note: The API endpoint details and schemas provided above are illustrative, based on the described functionalities of BondMCP. The definitive source for API endpoint structures, request/response bodies, and parameters is the OpenAPI specification generated by the actual BondMCP FastAPI application. The `openapi.json` file currently in the root of the `bondmcp_repo_clone` appears to be a placeholder or related to a different service (LangSmith). The next phase of documentation refinement will involve a deep parse of the BondMCP FastAPI application code (likely in `app/main.py` and `app/api/routers/` or similar) to extract and integrate its true OpenAPI schema into this documentation and the `api.bondmcp.com` portal.*

*(This concludes the detailed population and initial refactoring of the README.md. The document now contains comprehensive, codebase-derived information across all major sections, with placeholders largely eliminated. It is ready for final review, validation against the live system, and integration of the definitive BondMCP OpenAPI schema.)*



## Important Notice: Unification of Developer Portals and Deprecation of `my.bondmcp.com`

**The `my.bondmcp.com` domain and its associated functionalities are being deprecated.**

All developer-facing features previously available on `my.bondmcp.com`, including:
*   API Sandbox / Developer Playground
*   User Account Management (Registration, Login, Profile)
*   API Key Generation and Management
*   Billing and Subscription Management

have been merged into the unified developer portal at **`https://api.bondmcp.com`**.

This consolidation aims to provide a streamlined and comprehensive experience for all developers interacting with the BondMCP platform. Please update your bookmarks and workflows to use `https://api.bondmcp.com` for all your development needs, including accessing API documentation, managing your account and API keys, and utilizing the interactive API playground.

We encourage all users to transition to `https://api.bondmcp.com` as soon as possible. The `my.bondmcp.com` domain will be phased out in the near future. Further announcements regarding the final decommissioning date will be made available on `https://api.bondmcp.com`.



## 10. Custom Domain Setup for GitBook (`docs.bondmcp.com`)

This section details the steps taken to configure `docs.bondmcp.com` as a custom domain for the GitBook documentation site, its current status, and recommended next steps.

### Goal
The objective was to make the BondMCP project documentation, hosted on GitBook, accessible via the custom domain `docs.bondmcp.com`.

### Method
1.  **Initial API Attempt:** An initial attempt was made to configure the custom domain and retrieve DNS settings programmatically using the GitBook API. However, this approach was unsuccessful as the relevant API endpoints (`/v1/custom-hostnames/{hostname}`) returned a `403 Forbidden` error, indicating that the provided API token lacked the necessary permissions or that the endpoint requires internal GitBook user authentication.
2.  **Manual Setup via GitBook UI:** Following the API limitations, the process reverted to the standard method of configuring custom domains through the GitBook web UI. The user confirmed they had initiated this process.

### DNS Record Configuration (AWS Route 53)
Based on the information provided by the user (assumed to be from the GitBook UI), the following DNS record was intended for `bondmcp.com`'s hosted zone in AWS Route 53:
*   **Record Type:** `CNAME`
*   **Record Name (Host):** `docs` (resulting in `docs.bondmcp.com.`)
*   **Record Value (Target):** `2e9f9ce6a4-hosting.gitbook.io.`
*   **TTL (Time To Live):** 300 seconds (or a similarly low value to facilitate quick updates).

An attempt to create this record via AWS CLI indicated that the record already existed. This suggests it was either created manually by the user prior to this session, or an earlier automated attempt (not logged in the current context) was successful, or there was a delay in DNS record visibility during initial checks.

### Current Status (as of May 14, 2025, ~10:45 UTC)
*   **DNS Propagation:** **Successful.** Public DNS checks (using `dig @8.8.8.8 docs.bondmcp.com CNAME +short`) confirm that `docs.bondmcp.com` correctly resolves to `2e9f9ce6a4-hosting.gitbook.io.`.
*   **SSL Certificate Provisioning:** **Pending / Failed.** Attempts to access `https://docs.bondmcp.com` via `curl` and browser result in SSL errors (specifically, `error:0A000410:SSL routines::sslv3 alert handshake failure` and `net::ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH`). This indicates that while the DNS is correctly pointing to GitBook, the SSL certificate for the custom domain has not yet been successfully provisioned by GitBook.

### Next Steps and Recommendations
1.  **Wait for SSL Provisioning:** GitBook automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains once DNS records are correctly propagated. This process can take some time, often ranging from a few minutes to several hours (GitBook documentation suggests waiting at least 1 hour after DNS changes).
2.  **Periodic Re-checks:** Periodically check the status of `https://docs.bondmcp.com` by:
    *   Attempting to open it in a web browser (clearing cache if necessary).
    *   Using the command: `curl -vI https://docs.bondmcp.com` to inspect the SSL handshake and HTTP headers.
3.  **Verify GitBook Settings:** Double-check the custom domain settings within the GitBook UI to ensure there are no pending actions or error messages displayed there regarding the domain or SSL status.
4.  **Cloudflare Check (If Applicable):** If Cloudflare is used as a proxy for `bondmcp.com` (in front of AWS Route 53), ensure that the DNS record for `docs.bondmcp.com` in Cloudflare is set to "DNS Only" (not proxied/orange-clouded), as per GitBook's troubleshooting guidelines for Cloudflare users. This was not explicitly mentioned as being part of the setup, but it's a common point of failure.
5.  **Contact GitBook Support:** If the SSL certificate is not provisioned and the site remains inaccessible due to SSL errors after a reasonable waiting period (e.g., 12-24 hours), it is advisable to contact GitBook support for assistance, providing them with the domain name and the target CNAME value.
