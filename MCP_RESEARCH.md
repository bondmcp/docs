# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Research

## Fundamentals and Concepts

### Definition and Purpose
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables developers to build secure, two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools. It provides a universal interface for AI models to securely access various data sources without requiring custom integrations for each source.

As described by Anthropic: "Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools."

### Evolution of LLMs and Context Integration
The evolution of LLMs in relation to context can be understood in three stages:

1. **Basic LLMs: Limited to Text Generation**
   - Can only predict the next word in a sequence
   - Cannot perform meaningful actions in the real world
   - Limited utility in healthcare where accessing patient records and processing medical data is essential

2. **LLMs + Tools: Adding Capabilities Through Direct Integration**
   - LLMs connected to external tools and APIs
   - Allows searching the internet, accessing databases, processing emails
   - In healthcare: connecting to patient databases, medication reference services, clinical guidelines
   - Challenge: Maintaining connections between an LLM and various healthcare systems becomes complex

3. **LLMs + MCP: Standardized Protocol for Seamless Integration**
   - Standardized protocol between LLM and external services
   - Translates different data formats into a unified language for the LLM
   - Revolutionary for healthcare where system interoperability has been a persistent challenge

### MCP Architecture Components

1. **MCP Client**
   - Interface that connects directly to the LLM
   - Examples: Anthropic's Claude, Tempo, Windsurf, Cursor
   - In healthcare: Provider-facing interface for clinicians or patient-facing application

2. **MCP Protocol**
   - Standardized set of conventions governing information exchange
   - Ensures consistent communication regardless of tools/services used

3. **MCP Server**
   - Translates between MCP protocol and actual services/tools
   - For healthcare: Develops MCP servers that expose FHIR APIs, clinical tools, medical databases

4. **Services**
   - Actual healthcare services (FHIR databases, clinical decision support tools, etc.)
   - Connect to the MCP server

### MCP in Healthcare: Integration with FHIR

The healthcare industry has invested heavily in FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) as the standard for electronically exchanging healthcare information. FHIR's structured, consistent data model with well-defined resources (Patient, Medication, Condition, etc.) aligns perfectly with MCP's standardized approach.

#### Benefits of MCP + FHIR Integration:

1. **Standardized Access to Clinical Data**
   - Consistent way for LLMs to access FHIR resources across different EHR systems and healthcare platforms

2. **Tool Integration Without Complexity**
   - Healthcare requires numerous specialized tools (medication interaction checkers, clinical decision support)
   - MCP simplifies integration of these tools with AI systems

3. **Real-time Data Access**
   - MCP enables real-time access to patient data, vital signs, and lab results
   - Critical for time-sensitive clinical decisions

4. **Compliance and Security**
   - MCP's security features support HIPAA's safeguards
   - Enforces encryption, granular access controls, and multi-factor authentication
   - Standardizes data links for security and logging

### Security Considerations

1. **Stolen tokens and compromised accounts**
   - MCP storage of Open Authorization (OAuth) tokens is a critical vulnerability
   - Unauthorized access could lead to exposure of sensitive information

2. **Compromised MCP Servers**
   - MCP servers represent attractive targets for malicious actors
   - Could provide access to multiple services and data sources

3. **Indirect prompt injection threats**
   - AI assistants interpret natural language commands before sending to MCP server
   - Attackers could craft seemingly benign messages with concealed malicious instructions

### Best Practices for MCP Implementation

1. **Using a single multi-source MPC server**
   - Consolidate where enterprise data is already well documented and governed

2. **Getting IT, security, and business teams aligned**
   - Ensure cross-functional alignment on MCP implementation from the start

3. **Acquiring automated tools**
   - Implement tools for lineage and compliance to scale safely

4. **Data quality and governance**
   - Ensure high-quality metadata for clarity on meaning, access policies, update times, and ownership
   - Poor context leads to poor responses

5. **Security and monitoring**
   - Retrieve only necessary data
   - Enforce guardrails
   - Conduct regular audits
   - Monitor data freshness
   - Review and test prompts and agents to identify blind spots

## Healthcare Use Cases for MCP

1. **Radiology AI (CT/MRI Diagnostics)**
   - Integrate patient context (age, symptoms, history, prior studies) with image analysis
   - Query PACS, EHR, and genomic reports automatically
   - Push AI outputs to quality systems like ACR's Assess-AI registry

2. **Command Center / Operational AI**
   - Predict patient flow and staffing needs
   - Unify operational data (EHR discharge status, bed occupancy, pending tests) with workforce data
   - Alert staff to delays and potential barriers to discharge

3. **Patient Monitoring**
   - Detect patient deterioration earlier by analyzing trends in vital signs, labs, and clinical data
   - Ingest streaming data while fetching relevant EHR context
   - Log which data sources triggered alerts for clinical review and audit requirements

4. **Oncology AI (Treatment Pathway Recommendations)**
   - Connect to genomic databases, electronic medical records, and clinical trial repositories
   - Tailor recommendations based on tumor's molecular profile and up-to-date guidelines
   - Ensure advice is grounded in latest patient-specific data and institutional protocols

## Value Proposition of MCP

1. **Integrated Context for Better Decisions**
   - Feeds AI models with up-to-date, domain-specific data
   - Makes outputs more relevant and evidence-based
   - Reduces errors from stale or incomplete inputs

2. **Transparency and Explainability**
   - Standardizes data flows so every inference carries a data lineage
   - Enables audit trails and explainable outputs
   - Critical for healthcare where practitioners and regulators demand clear reasoning

3. **Building Trust with Clinicians and Patients**
   - Predictable AI behavior with clear data usage
   - Consistent results whether running in cloud or on hospital workstation
   - Verification of which data was used in decision-making

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Security-by-design features align with HIPAA and GDPR requirements
   - Controlled connectors make it easier to enforce consent and audit usage
   - Natural tagging of data with source and version simplifies meeting FDA guidelines

5. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Feeds results back into the loop
   - Enables monitoring dashboards and drift detectors
   - Drives learning health system where each AI inference becomes data point for quality improvement
