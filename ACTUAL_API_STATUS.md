# Actual BondMCP API Status Report

> **Report Generated**: August 23, 2025  
> **Testing Target**: https://api.bondmcp.com  
> **Purpose**: Document actual functionality vs documented claims

## ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING

**API Domain Does Not Exist**: DNS lookup for `api.bondmcp.com` fails with "REFUSED" status.

```bash
$ nslookup api.bondmcp.com
** server can't find api.bondmcp.com: REFUSED
```

**Conclusion**: All documented API endpoints are non-functional because the domain doesn't resolve.

## Summary

- **Documented Claims**: 99% functional (README.md), 14.3% functional (ENDPOINTS.md)
- **Actual Status**: 0% functional - API domain doesn't exist
- **Impact**: All SDKs, examples, and documentation reference a non-existent API

## Endpoint Testing Results

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Update all documentation to reflect that the API is in development/planning phase
2. **Short-term**: Remove all false claims of functionality from README.md and other docs
3. **Medium-term**: Implement actual API infrastructure at api.bondmcp.com
4. **Long-term**: Align all SDKs and examples with actual deployed functionality
