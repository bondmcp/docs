# Best Practices

## Security and Compliance

### API Key Management
- Store API keys securely using environment variables or secret management systems
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different keys for development, staging, and production environments

```python
import os
from bondmcp import Client

# Secure API key usage
api_key = os.getenv('BONDMCP_API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("BONDMCP_API_KEY environment variable not set")

client = Client(api_key=api_key)
```

### Data Privacy
- Implement proper data anonymization for patient information
- Follow HIPAA, GDPR, and other relevant privacy regulations
- Use secure transmission protocols (HTTPS/TLS)

### Error Handling
```python
try:
    response = client.ask(query)
    return response.answer
except bondmcp.RateLimitError:
    # Handle rate limiting gracefully
    time.sleep(60)
    return get_health_info_with_retry(query)
except bondmcp.APIError as e:
    # Log error and provide fallback
    logger.error(f"BondMCP API error: {e}")
    return "Unable to process health query at this time"
```

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Cache frequently requested health information
- Implement intelligent cache invalidation
- Use Redis or similar for distributed caching

### Rate Limiting
- Implement client-side rate limiting
- Use exponential backoff for retries
- Monitor API usage and adjust limits accordingly

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple queries efficiently
queries = ["What is diabetes?", "Symptoms of hypertension", "COVID-19 prevention"]
responses = client.batch_ask(queries)
```

## Integration Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
- Create dedicated health AI microservices
- Implement proper service discovery
- Use circuit breakers for resilience

### Event-Driven Processing
- Use message queues for asynchronous processing
- Implement proper event sourcing for audit trails
- Handle eventual consistency in distributed systems

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def log_health_query(query, response, user_id):
    logger.info(
        "Health query processed",
        extra={
            "user_id": user_id,
            "query_length": len(query),
            "response_time": response.processing_time,
            "confidence": response.confidence
        }
    )
```

### Metrics and Alerting
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Set up alerts for unusual patterns or errors
- Track user engagement and satisfaction metrics

### Health Checks
```python
def health_check():
    try:
        client.ping()
        return {"status": "healthy", "bondmcp": "connected"}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
```
