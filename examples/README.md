# Code Examples

Welcome to the BondMCP code examples repository. Here you'll find practical implementations, use cases, and best practices for integrating with our health AI platform.

## Quick Examples

### Basic Health Query
```python
import bondmcp

client = bondmcp.Client(api_key="your-api-key")
response = client.ask("What are the symptoms of diabetes?")
print(response.answer)
```

### Lab Results Analysis
```javascript
const bondmcp = require('bondmcp');
const client = new bondmcp.Client('your-api-key');

const labResults = {
  glucose: 180,
  hba1c: 7.2,
  cholesterol: 220
};

const analysis = await client.labs.interpret(labResults);
console.log(analysis.insights);
```
