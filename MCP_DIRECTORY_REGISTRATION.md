## Implementation Code

### MCP Configuration Endpoint

Create the well-known MCP configuration endpoint at `/.well-known/mcp-configuration`:

```python
@app.route('/.well-known/mcp-configuration')
def mcp_configuration():
    return jsonify({
        "name": "BondMCP Healthcare MCP",
        "description": "Healthcare data and analysis capabilities for AI models",
        "contact_email": "api@bondmcp.com",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "auth": {
            "type": "api_key",
            "location": "header",
            "key": "X-API-Key"
        },
        "servers": [
            {
                "id": "lab-results",
                "url": "https://api.bondmcp.com/mcp/servers/lab-results",
                "description": "Laboratory results interpretation"
            },
            {
                "id": "vitals",
                "url": "https://api.bondmcp.com/mcp/servers/vitals",
                "description": "Vital signs data and analysis"
            }
        ],
        "capabilities_url": "https://api.bondmcp.com/mcp/capabilities",
        "documentation_url": "https://docs.bondmcp.com/mcp",
        "health_check_url": "https://api.bondmcp.com/health",
        "logo_url": "https://bondmcp.com/assets/mcp-logo.png",
        "categories": ["healthcare", "medical", "lab-results", "vitals"]
    })
```

### Health Check Endpoint

Implement a health check endpoint:

```python
@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    # Check all MCP servers
    servers_status = {}
    for server_id in server_registry.list_servers():
        try:
            # Basic check that server is responsive
            server = server_registry.get_server(server_id)
            servers_status[server_id] = "healthy"
        except Exception:
            servers_status[server_id] = "unhealthy"

    # Overall health is healthy only if all servers are healthy
    overall_status = "healthy" if all(status == "healthy" for status in servers_status.values()) else "degraded"

    return jsonify({
        "status": overall_status,
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
        "servers": servers_status
    })
```
